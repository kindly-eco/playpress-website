          <h3>Award-winning collaboration with RNLI</h3>
          <img
            src="https://via.placeholder.com/600x350.webp?text=RNLI collaboration image"

          <p>
            We have been very lucky to be able to work with the RNLI on a
            inshore life boat set and an RNLI people set. Together with the
            licensing team and brand designers we created and manufactured two
            products from scratch that have an authentic RNLI feel and are
            amazingly fun to build and play with. The lifeboat set has been
            nominated for Toy Designer of the Year (Licensed Product), which we
            are so excited about.

          <h3>Our collaboration with the Science Museum</h3>

          <p>
            It was a fantastic opportunity to work with the Science Museum to
            produce a space range to co-inside with the opening of there newly
            refurbished shop. Working with there brand designers we created a
            stand out high impact packing design for three space products. We
            also designed a set based on one of there most popular pieces the
            Soyuz return capsule.

      <h4>Pricing and Quantity</h4>
      <p>
        It is not normally commercially viable to create a new set from scratch
        without a reasonable assumption of annual sales, otherwise it would
        impact too heavily on the RSP. Generally, 500 sales per annum would be a
        starting minimum order quantity. If the product has potential for
        licensing and sales to other retailers smaller MOQ are possible.
