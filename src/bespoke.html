      <h2>Bespoke products</h2>
      <p>
        We love to design and make environmentally responsible fun play sets.
        Recently we’ve been working with some great brands creating really fun
        toys that generate value for these amazing institutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our offering ranges from the ‘white labelling’ of our existing products
        to making something special and completely unique.

      <h4>Viability</h4>
      <h5>Every project will have a budget!</h5>
      <p>
        The design, set up, and machinery set up involved generally means that
        most projects need to have a volume of between 1000 and 5000 units - the
        larger the number the lower the ‘per unit’ cost is.
      </p>
      <p>
        Depending on the project required, the initial budget expectation would
        be between £6000 and £12,000, but this would deliver a delightful and
        unique addition to your brand.
