      <h1>A world of creativity that doesn’t cost the earth</h1>
      <h2>Educational, creative – and fun!</h2>
      <p>
        Playpress is about exploring new possibilities. We take care to make our
        toys inclusive. They’re designed to let children play creatively while
        helping them develop key motor and cognitive reasoning skills.

      <h3>Sustainability and quality</h3>
      <p>
        We don’t think that quality toys need to cost the earth. That’s why we
        put care into every part of our product, from the sourcing of our
        materials through to responsible manufacturing and design.

          Our mascot Playpress Pete was named after our very own Peter, the
          creative brains behind his beaming smile. Playpress Pete is our seal
          of quality – you’ll find him on the back of every Playpress pack.

      <h3>We love finding new ways to build new worlds</h3>
      <p>
        We created Playpress because we wanted to help children create new
        stories with toys that were affordable and eco-friendly. Our love of
        creativity and ingenuity is what gets us up every day and as a
        family-owned business, care and quality really matter to us.
